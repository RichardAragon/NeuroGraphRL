# NeuroGraphRL
The world's first Graph Neural Network Based Reinforcement Learning Implementation!

NeuroGraphRL is a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and energy-conserving strategies to train AI agents on complex environments, such as Atari games. This framework leverages the power of graph-based processing and visual feature extraction to create smarter and more efficient agents that understand both the spatial and structural elements of their environment.

Overview
NeuroGraphRL combines three powerful techniques in one unified framework:

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Uses Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to process spatial and relational information of environments, like Q*bert, by representing game levels as graphs.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Extracts visual features from game frames to help the agent make informed decisions.
Energy-Conserving Strategies: Introduces the concept of energy conservation to encourage agents to make more efficient moves and avoid self-destructive behaviors.
The framework is designed to train agents that can learn not just from pixel-based inputs but also from the structural layout of their environment, providing a deeper understanding of how actions affect outcomes.

Features
Hybrid Neural Network Architecture: Combines CNNs for visual processing with GNNs for understanding spatial structures.
Energy-Based Reward System: Encourages agents to conserve energy and avoid harmful actions, such as jumping off platforms in games like Q*bert.
Replay Buffer for Experience Replay: Stores past experiences to accelerate learning by sampling from a diverse set of states.
Epsilon-Greedy Policy: Balances exploration and exploitation to optimize agent performance.
Graph Representation of Game Levels: Leverages networkx and torch-geometric to represent game environments as graphs.
Architecture
The architecture consists of:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Extracts features from raw game frames.
Graph Attention Networks (GATs): Processes game levels represented as graphs.
Energy-Conserving Module: Monitors the agent's energy level and penalizes wasteful actions.
Dueling Q-Network: Splits the neural network into value and advantage streams to improve the stability of Q-learning.

Results
The initial results demonstrate that the energy-conserving reward system and graph-based spatial understanding significantly improve the agent's performance compared to traditional DQN-based agents. Agents trained with NeuroGraphRL show better decision-making and longer survival times in complex environments.
